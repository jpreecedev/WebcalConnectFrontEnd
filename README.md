# WebcalConnect.com
[WebcalConnect.com](https://www.webcalconnect.com) has been re-written from scratch to fully utilize the power and usability of Angular 2.

Before the switch, WebcalConnect was written in ASP .NET MVC and jQuery.  We found that whilst the website was relatively quick at first, as time went by the site generally became sluggish and bloated.  Angular 2 has gone a long way to alleviate that problem.  The front end is powered by a seperate ASP .NET Web API project, which is currently closed source.

To see the website in action, go to [https://www.webcalconnect.com](https://www.webcalconnect.com).
